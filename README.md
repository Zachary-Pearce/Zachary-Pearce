Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Zachary Pearce

I am an Electrical and Electronic Engineering Student currently pursuing a Masters at the [University of Hertfordshire](https://www.herts.ac.uk/). I have always had an interest in computer science, but shared a greater if not equal passion for engineering, the perfect blend of these two fields is computer hardware engineering. As such I have pursued projects in this area, the largest of which being Pomegranate, an open source portable and scalable soft-core processor developed in VHDL for my thesis in the final year of my undergrad.

Pomegranate was a resounding success, however it can still be improved upon, thus I will continue to maintain and build upon it. Updates regarding the development of Pomegranate are posted on my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-pearce-231307243/). If you would like to learn more about Pomegranate, please visit the [repository](https://github.com/Zachary-Pearce/Pomegranate).
